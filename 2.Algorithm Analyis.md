# 2.1 The RAM Model of Computation

### RAM: Random Access Machine

- Using the RAM model, we measure run time by counting up the number of steps an algorithm takes on a given instance.

- Assume given number of steps by second, this operation count converts to the actual running time.

## 2.1.1 Best, Worst, and Average-Case Complexity
![Best, worst, and average Complexity](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot1.jpg
)

- The worst-case is defined by MAX number of steps taken by any instance of size n. (Most useful)

- The best-case is defined by MIN number....

- The average-case is defined by Average number...


# 2.2 Big Oh Notation
![Upper and Lower bounds](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot2.jpg)

- For easier to talk in terms of simple upper and lower bounds of time Complexity using Big Oh notation.

The formal definition:
  - f(n) = _O(g(n))_ means c * g(n) is an upper bound on f(n)
    - f(n) ≥ c1 * g(n)
  - f(n) = _Ω(g(n))_ means c * g(n) is an lower bound on f(n)
    - f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n)
  - f(n) = _Θ(g(n))_ means c * g(n) is a exactly nice, tight bound on f(n).
    - f(n) ≤ c1 * g(n) && f(n) ≥ c2 * g(n)
  - All of above satisfy for large enough n(i.e. n ≥ n0 )

**Note**:The Big Oh notation and worst-case analysis are tools that greatly simplify out ability to compare the efficiency of Algorithms.
