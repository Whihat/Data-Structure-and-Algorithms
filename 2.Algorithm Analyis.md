# 2.1 The RAM Model of Computation

### RAM: Random Access Machine

- Using the RAM model, we measure run time by counting up the number of steps an algorithm takes on a given instance.

- Assume given number of steps by second, this operation count converts to the actual running time.

## 2.1.1 Best, Worst, and Average-Case Complexity
![Best, worst, and average Complexity](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot1.jpg
)

- The worst-case is defined by MAX number of steps taken by any instance of size n. (Most useful)

- The best-case is defined by MIN number....

- The average-case is defined by Average number...


# 2.2 Big Oh Notation



- For easier to talk in terms of simple upper and lower bounds of time Complexity using Big Oh notation.
