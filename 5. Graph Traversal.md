# 5.1 Flavours of Graph
- Graph: A graph **G(V, E)** is defined on a _set_ of vertices(point) V, and contains a _set_ of edges E of ordered or unordered pairs vertices from V.
#### Undirected vs. Directed
- A graph G = (V, E) is **undirected** if edge （x, y) ∈ E => (y, x) also ∈ E
- if not, **directed** <br />

#### Weighted vs. Unweighted
- Each edge(or vertex) in a **weighted** graph G  is assigned a numerical value.
- if not assigned, **Unweighted** <br />
![Weighted vs. Unweighted](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot5.jpg)
#### Simple vs. Non-Simple
- A self-loop is an edge (x, x) involving only one vertex. An edge (x, y) is a multi-edge if it occurs more than once in the graph is called **Non-simple**
- Any graph that avoids them is called **Simple** <br />
![Simple vs. Non-Simple](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot6.jpg)
#### cyclic vs. Acyclic
- An **acyclic** graph does not contain any cycles. Trees are connected, acyclic(_non-periodic_) undirected graphs. i.e. Trees
- Directed acyclic graphs are called **DAGs**, they arise in scheduling problems where a directed edge(x, y) indicates that activity x must occur before y.
- _Topological sorting_ orders the vertices of a DAG to respect these precedence(priority) constraints. Topological sorting is the first step to do DAGs algorithm. <br />

## 5.1.1 The Friendship Graph
- _If I am your friend, does that mean you are my friend?_
   - directed or undirected graph
- _How close a friend are you?_
  - weighted graph
- _Am I my own friend?_
  - simple graph
- _Who has the most friends?_
  - the degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it
- _Do my friends live near me?_
  - embedded(enclosed) graph
- _Oh, you also know her?_
  - premise of explicitly(correct rate) link.
- _Are you truly an individual, or just one of the faceless crowd?_
  - label or unlabelled

**Take-Home-Lesson**: Graphs can be used to model a wide variety of structures and relationships. Graph-theoretic terminology gives us a language to talk about them.


#5.2 Data structure for graphs
Basically two choices:
  1). Adjacency Matrix.
  2). Adjacency Lists.

1. Adjacency Matrix
- We can represent G using an n × n matrix M, where element M[i, j] = 1 if (i, j) is an edge of G, and 0 if it isn’t. This allows fast answers to the question “is (i, j) in G?”
- However if number of vertices are large, adjacency matrix would be very large.

2. Adjacency Lists
- Using _linked list_ to store the neighbours adjacent to each vertex. Adjacency list require pointers
- Adjacency lists are the right data structure for most applications of Graphs <br />

#### Structure Build
```
  #define MAXV 1000        /* maximum number of vertices */

  typedef struct {
    int y;                 /* adjacency info */
    int weight;            /* edge weight, if any */
    struct edgenode *next; /* next edge in list */
  }edgenode;

  typedef struct {
    edgenode *edges[MAXV+1]; /* adjacency info */
    int degree[MAXV+1];      /* out-degree of each vertex */
    int nvertices;           /* number of vertices in graph */
    int nedges;              /* number of edges in graph */
    bool directed;           /* is the graph directed? */
  }graph;
```
We represent directed edge (x, y) by an edgenode y in x's adjacency list <br />
An undirected edge (x, y) appears twice in any adjacency-based graph structure, once as x in y, once as y in x.

#### Read a graph from file
```
  initialise_graph(graph *g, bool directed){
    int i;            /* counter */

    g -> nvertices = 0;
    g -> nedges = 0;
    g -> directed = directed;

    for (i=1; i<=MAXV; i++) g->degree[i] = 0;
    for (i=1; i<=MAXV; i++) g->edges[i] = NULL;
  }

  read_graph(graph *g, bool directed){
    int i;          /* counter */
    int m;          /* number of edges */
    int x,y;        /* vertices in edge(x, y) */

    initialise_graph(g, directed);

    scanf("%d %d,&(g->nvertices), &m");

    for(i=1; i<=m, i++){
      scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);   /* !!(x, y) is edgenode y in x's adjacency list */
      insert_edge(g, x, y, directed);
    }
  }

  insert_edge(graph *g, int x, int y, bool directed){
    edgenode *p;                /* temporary pointer */

    p = malloc(sizeof(edgende));/* allocate edgenode storage */

    p->weigt = NULL;
    p->y = y;                     /* y is another vertices in this edge
    p->next = g->edges[x];        /* now edges[x] is NULL */

    g->edges[x] = p;              /* insert at the head of list */

    g->degree[x] ++;              /* one node can connect with current x */

    if(directed == False)         /* count twice */
      insert_edge(g, y, x, TRUE);
    else
      g->nodges ++;
  }
```

#### Print graph
```
  print_graph(graph *g){
    int i;                /* counter */
    edgenode *p;          /* temporary pointer */

    for(i=1; i<=g->nvertices; i++){
      pitntf("%d: ",i);
      p = p->edges[i];        /* reset p to next edges */
      while(p != NULL) {
        printf(" %d", p->y);
        p = p->next;
      }
      printf("\n");
    }
  }
```


## 5.5 Traversing(through) a Graph
The key idea behind graph traversing is to mark each vertex when we first visist it and keep track of what we have not yet completely explored. We will rely on Boolean flags(T,F) or enumerated type(1,0) to mark visited places.

Each vertex will exist in one of three states:
  - _undiscovered_ - the vertex is inits initial, virgin state
  - _discovered_ - the vertex has been found, but we have not yet checked all its incident edge
  - _processed_ - the vertex after we have visited all its incident edges
Each undirected edge will be considered exactly twice


## 5.6 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
In a breadth-first search of an **undirected** graph, assign a direction to each edge, from the **discoverer** _u_ to the **discovered** _v_. Thus we denote _u_ is parent of _v_. Since each node has exactly one parent, expect root(no parent), this defined a tree on the vertices of the graph.
<br />
![BFS ](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot9.jpg)

#### BFS pseudocode
```
  BFS(G,s) s-start point
    for each vertex u ∈ V[G] - {s} do
      state[u] = "undiscovered"
      p[u] = nil, i.e. no parent is in the BFS tree
    state[s] = "discovered"
    p[s] = nil
    Q = {s}
    while Q = ∅ do
      u = dequeue[Q]
      process vertex u as desired
      for each v ∈ Adj[u] do
        process edge (u,v) as desired
        if state[v] = "undicovered" then
          state[v] = "discovered"
          p[v] = u
          enqueue[Q,v]
        state[u] = "processed"
```
