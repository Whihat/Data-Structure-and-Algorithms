# 5.1 Flavours of Graph
- Graph: A graph **G(V, E)** is defined on a _set_ of vertices(point) V, and contains a _set_ of edges E of ordered or unordered pairs vertices from V.
#### Undirected vs. Directed
- A graph G = (V, E) is **undirected** if edge （x, y) ∈ E => (y, x) also ∈ E
- if not, **directed** <br />
![undirected vs. directed](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot4.jpg)
#### Weighted vs. Unweighted
- Each edge(or vertex) in a **weighted** graph G  is assigned a numerical value.
- if not assigned, **Unweighted** <br />
![Weighted vs. Unweighted](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot5.jpg)
#### Simple vs. Non-Simple
- A self-loop is an edge (x, x) involving only one vertex. An edge (x, y) is a multi-edge if it occurs more than once in the graph is called **Non-simple**
- Any graph that avoids them is called **Simple** <br />
![Simple vs. Non-Simple](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot6.jpg)
#### cyclic vs. Acyclic
- An **acyclic** graph does not contain any cycles. Trees are connected, acyclic(_non-periodic_) undirected graphs. i.e. Trees
- Directed acyclic graphs are called **DAGs**, they arise in scheduling problems where a directed edge(x, y) indicates that activity x must occur before y.
- _Topological sorting_ orders the vertices of a DAG to respect these precedence(priority) constraints. Topological sorting is the first step to do DAGs algorithm. <br />

## 5.1.1 The Friendship Graph
- _If I am your friend, does that mean you are my friend?_
   - directed or undirected graph
- _How close a friend are you?_
  - weighted graph
- _Am I my own friend?_
  - simple graph
- _Who has the most friends?_
  - the degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it
- _Do my friends live near me?_
  - embedded(enclosed) graph
- _Oh, you also know her?_
  - premise of explicitly(correct rate) link.
- _Are you truly an individual, or just one of the faceless crowd?_
  - label or unlabelled

**Take-Home-Lesson**: Graphs can be used to model a wide variety of structures and relationships. Graph-theoretic terminology gives us a language to talk about them.


# 5.2 Data structure for graphs
Basically two choices:
  1). Adjacency Matrix.
  2). Adjacency Lists.

1. Adjacency Matrix
- We can represent G using an n × n matrix M, where element M[i, j] = 1 if (i, j) is an edge of G, and 0 if it isn’t. This allows fast answers to the question “is (i, j) in G?”
- However if number of vertices are large, adjacency matrix would be very large.

2. Adjacency Lists
- Using _linked list_ to store the neighbours adjacent to each vertex. Adjacency list require pointers
- Adjacency lists are the right data structure for most applications of Graphs <br />

![Adjacency matrix vs.adjacency list ](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot8.jpg)

#### Structure Build
```
  #define MAXV 1000        /* maximum number of vertices */

  typedef struct {
    int y;                 /* adjacency info */
    int weight;            /* edge weight, if any */
    struct edgenode *next; /* next edge in list */
  }edgenode;

  typedef struct {
    edgenode *edges[MAXV+1]; /* adjacency info */
    int degree[MAXV+1];      /* out-degree of each vertex */
    int nvertices;           /* number of vertices in graph */
    int nedges;              /* number of edges in graph */
    bool directed;           /* is the graph directed? */
  }graph;
```
![struct schema](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot9.jpg))

We represent directed edge (x, y) by an edgenode y in x's adjacency list. <br />
An undirected edge (x, y) appears twice in any adjacency-based graph structure, once as x in y, once as y in x.

#### Read a graph from file
```
  initialise_graph(graph *g, bool directed){
    int i;            /* counter */

    g -> nvertices = 0;
    g -> nedges = 0;
    g -> directed = directed;

    for (i=1; i<=MAXV; i++) g->degree[i] = 0;
    for (i=1; i<=MAXV; i++) g->edges[i] = NULL;
  }

  read_graph(graph *g, bool directed){
    int i;          /* counter */
    int m;          /* number of edges */
    int x,y;        /* vertices in edge(x, y) */

    initialise_graph(g, directed);

    scanf("%d %d,&(g->nvertices), &m");

    for(i=1; i<=m, i++){
      scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);   /* !!(x, y) is edgenode y in x's adjacency list */
      insert_edge(g, x, y, directed);
    }
  }

  insert_edge(graph *g, int x, int y, bool directed){
    edgenode *p;                /* temporary pointer */

    p = malloc(sizeof(edgende));/* allocate edgenode storage */

    p->weigt = NULL;
    p->y = y;                     /* y is another vertices in this edge
    p->next = g->edges[x];        /* now edges[x] is NULL */

    g->edges[x] = p;              /* insert at the head of list */

    g->degree[x] ++;              /* one node can connect with current x */

    if(directed == False)         /* count twice */
      insert_edge(g, y, x, TRUE);
    else
      g->nodges ++;
  }
```

#### Print graph
```
  print_graph(graph *g){
    int i;                /* counter */
    edgenode *p;          /* temporary pointer */

    for(i=1; i<=g->nvertices; i++){
      pitntf("%d: ",i);
      p = p->edges[i];        /* reset p to next edges */
      while(p != NULL) {
        printf(" %d", p->y);
        p = p->next;
      }
      printf("\n");
    }
  }
```


## 5.5 Traversing(through) a Graph
The key idea behind graph traversing is to mark each vertex when we first visist it and keep track of what we have not yet completely explored. We will rely on Boolean flags(T,F) or enumerated type(1,0) to mark visited places.

Each vertex will exist in one of three states:
  - _undiscovered_ - the vertex is inits initial, virgin state
  - _discovered_ - the vertex has been found, but we have not yet checked all its incident edge
  - _processed_ - the vertex after we have visited all its incident edges
Each undirected edge will be considered exactly twice


## 5.6 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
In a breadth-first search of an **undirected** graph, assign a direction to each edge, from the **discoverer** _u_ to the **discovered** _v_. Thus we denote _u_ is parent of _v_. Since each node has exactly one parent, expect root(no parent), this defined a tree on the vertices of the graph.
<br />
![BFS ](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot11.jpg)

#### BFS pseudocode
```
  BFS(G,s) s-start point
    for each vertex u ∈ V[G] - {s} do
      state[u] = "undiscovered"
      p[u] = nil, i.e. no parent is in the BFS tree
    state[s] = "discovered"
    p[s] = nil
    Q = {s}
    while Q = ∅ do
      u = dequeue[Q]
      process vertex u as desired
      for each v ∈ Adj[u] do
        process edge (u,v) as desired
        if state[v] = "undicovered" then
          state[v] = "discovered"
          p[v] = u
          enqueue[Q,v]
        state[u] = "processed"
```
![BFS example](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot12.jpg)

Note:
      1. the Graph edges that do not appear in the BFS tree.
      2. For undirected graphs, non-tree edges can point only to vertices on the same level as the parent, or to vertices on the level directly below the parent.
      3. For directed graph, a back-pointing edge (u, v) can exist whenever v lies closer to the root than u does.

#### BFS Implementation
```
  bool processed[MAXV+1];   /* which vertices have been processed */
  bool discovered[MAXV+1];  /* which vertices have been found */
  int parent[MAXV+1];       /* discovery relation */
```
```
  /* Each vertex is initialised as undiscovered: */

  initialise_search(graph *g){
    int i;                  /* counter */

    for(i=1; i<g->nvertices; i++){
      processed[i] = discovered[i] = FALSE;
      parent[i] = -1;
    }
  }

  /*
  Once a vertex is discovered, it is placed on a queue. Since we process these vertices in FIFO order. the oldest vertices are expanded first, which are exactly those closest to the root
  */

  bfs(graph *g, int start){
    queue q;        /* queue of vertices to visit */
    int v;          /* current vertex */     
    int y;          /* successor(inheritor) vertex */
    edgenode *p;    /* temporary pointer */

    init_queue(*q);
    enqueue(&q, start);
    discovered[start] = TRUE

    while (empty_queue(&q) == FALSE){
      v= dequeue(&q);
      process_vertex_early(v);    /* printf("processed vertex %d\n",v); */
      processed[v] = True;
      p = g->edges[v];
      while(p != NULL){
        y = p->y;
        if((processed[y] == FALSE) || g->directed)
          process_edge(v, y);     /* printf("processed edge (%d,%d)\n",x,y); */
        if(discovered[y] == FALSE){
          enqueue(&q, y);
          discovered[y] = TRUE;
          parent[y] = v;
        }
        p = p->next;
      }
      process_vertex_late(v);     /* do without action */
    }
  }

  /* if we set: */
    process_edge(int x, int y){
      nedges += 1;
    }

  /* can get accurate count of the number of edges. Different algorithms perform different actions. */
```


# 5.7 Applications of Breadth-First Search
-BFS runs in O(m+n) time on both directed and undirected graphs.n-vertex, m-edge

# 5.8 Depth-First Search(DFS)
The difference between BFS and DFS results is in the _order_ in which they explore vertices. This order depends upon the container data structure used to stored the discovered but not processed vertices.
  - _Queue_ - By storing the vertices in a first-in, first-out(**FIFO**) queue, we explore the oldest unexplored vertices first. **Thus our explorations radiate out slowly from the starting vertex**, defining _BFS_.
  - _Stack_ - By storing the vertices in a last-in, first-out(LIFO) stack, we explore the vertices by lunching a path, visiting a new neighbour if one is available, and backing up only when we are surrounded by previously discovered vertices. **Thus, our explorations quickly wander away from our starting point**, defining _DFS_.

#### DFS pseudocode
```
  DFS(G,u)
    state[u] = "discovered"
    process vertex u if desired
    time = time + 1
    entry[u] = time
    for each v ∈ Adj[u] do
      process edge(u,v) if desired
      if state[v] = "undiscovered" then
        p[v] = u
        DFS(G,v)
    state[u] = "processed"
    exit[u] = time
    time = time + 1
```
Note: The time intervals have a interesting and useful properties with respect to DFS.

  - _Who is ancestor?_ suppose x is an ancestor of y in DFS, then the interval of y must smaller than x.
  - _How many descendants?_ The difference of exit and entry times for v tells us how any descendants v has in the DFS.

_tree edges_ : discover new vertices, and are those encoded in the **parent** relation
_back edges_ : are those whose other endpoint is ancestor of the vertex being expanded before we finish with traversal from v, so such topologies are impossible for undirected graphs.
!DFS TREE](https://github.com/Whihat/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot13.jpg)

### Implementation
A DFS can be thought of as a BFS with a _stack_ instead of a queue. The beauty of implementing DFS recursively is that recursion eliminates the need to keep an explicit stack

#### DFS code
```
  dfs(graph *g, int v){
    edgenode *p;         /* temporary pointer */
    int y;               /* successor vertex */

    if(finished) return; /* allow for search termination */

    discovered[v] = TRUE;
    time = time + 1;
    entry_time[v] = time;

    process_vertex_early(v);

    p = g->edges[v];
    while(p != NULL){
      y = p->y;
      if(discovered[y] == FALSE){
        parent[y] = v;
        process_edge(v,y);
        dfs(g,y);
      }
      else if ((!processed[y] && (parent[v]! = y)) || (g->directed))
        process_edge(v,y);

      if(finished) reurn;

      p = p->next;
    }
    process_vertex_late(v);

    time = time + 1;
    exit_time[v] = time;

    processed[v] = True
  }
```
**Take-Home-Lesson**: DFS organises vertices by entry/exit times, and edges into tree and back edges. This organisation is what gives DFS its real power.
