# 5.1 Flavours of Graph
- Graph: A graph **G(V, E)** is defined on a _set_ of vertices V, and contains a _set_ of edges E of ordered or unordered pairs vertices from V.
#### Undirected vs. Directed
- A graph G = (V, E) is **undirected** if edge （x, y) ∈ E => (y, x) also ∈ E
- if not, **directed**

#### Weighted vs. Unweighted
- Each edge(or vertex) in a **weighted** graph G  is assigned a numerical value.
- if not assigned, **Unweighted**

#### Simple vs. Non-Simple
- A self-loop is an edge (x, x) involving only one vertex. An edge (x, y) is a multi-edge if it occurs more than once in the graph is called **Non-simple**
- Any graph that avoids them is called **Simple**

#### cyclic vs. Acyclic
- An **acyclic** graph does not contain any cycles. Trees are connected, acyclic(_non-periodic_) undirected graphs. i.e. Trees
- Directed acyclic graphs are called **DAGs**, they arise in scheduling problems where a directed edge(x, y) indicates that activity x must occur before y.
- _Topological sorting_ orders the vertices of a DAG to respect these precedence(priority) constraints. Topological sorting is the first step to do DAGs algorithm.

## 5.1.1 The Friendship Graph
- _If I am your friend, does that mean you are my friend?_
   - directed or undirected graph
- _How close a friend are you?_
  - weighted graph
- _Am I my own friend?_
  - simple graph
- _Who has the most friends?_
  - the degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it
- _Do my friends live near me?_
  - embedded(enclosed) graph
- _Oh, you also know her?_
  - premise of explicitly(correct rate) link.
- _Are you truly an individual, or just one of the faceless crowd?_
  - label or unlabelled
